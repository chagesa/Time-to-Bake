				<H1>Where Does the Time Go???</H1>
				<p>Where does the time go? I have lots of things I like to spend my time doing, but some things grab me more then others. I find that other than getting lost in my computer, the one other thing I can easily get lost in is baking. I can spend hours on end standing on my feet, measuring, stirring and baking.</p>
			
				<p>I'm not sure what it is about baking. Is it the precision needed in following a recipe? Is it taking raw ingredients and seeing them transform into something new and delicious? Is it the satisfaction I get from everyone enjoying the end result? I think it's all the above! I can't explain why but I seem to get a thrill out of it. I have been spending more and more time creating wonderful treats for my friends and family to enjoy. I have been spending lots of time recently testing recipes for a cookbook, which will hopefully be coming out soon. Besides for the recipes I have been testing, I have been getting a lot of my new recipe from Pintrest. There are so many amazing ideas there! I have been finding treasures! I am looking forward to exploring and finding more treasures in the future. </p>
